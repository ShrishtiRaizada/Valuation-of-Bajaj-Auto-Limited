DCF Valuation Model – Bajaj Auto Limited (Excel-Based Financial Model)

This repository contains a complete valuation of Bajaj Auto Limited, developed through a detailed Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model built in Microsoft Excel. 
The model leverages five years of historical data (FY 2020–FY 2025) to derive operational assumptions and projects Free Cash Flow performance until FY 2032, 
discounting them to compute intrinsic equity value.

Revenue projections were derived from historical growth trends, supported by COGS averaging 70.5%–72.8% of revenue, while EBITDA, EBIT, and NOPAT were estimated using historical cost ratios and effective tax rates between 18.15%–21.56%. 
Operational forecasts incorporated detailed balance sheet drivers, including DSO, DIO, and DPO ranges of 17–35 and 54–85 days, alongside PP&E schedules driven by historical D&A (15–16% of beginning PP&E) and CapEx assumptions (22%–64%). 
Using CAPM-based cost of equity (levered beta 0.77 and risk-free rate 6.97%) and after-tax cost of debt (5.11%), the model derived a WACC of 16.57% to discount future Free Cash Flows, which ranged from ₹9,981.99 million to ₹18,806.66 million. 
The resulting DCF produced an enterprise value of ₹122,094.66 million, equity value of ₹32,146.94 million, and an implied intrinsic share price of ₹1,150.98.


A two-variable data table tests the effect of:

1. Terminal growth rates from 4.00% to 6.00%

2. WACC fluctuations from 15.57% to 17.57%

Despite variations, the implied share value remained around ₹1,150.98, reinforcing valuation stability.
